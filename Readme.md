Install AvalancheJS: This is the official Avalanche platform library for JavaScript. You can install it using npm:
npm install avalanche

Import the AvalancheJS library and create an instance:
JavaScript

const avalanche = require('avalanche');
const avax = new avalanche.Avalanche("https://api.avax.network", 443, "https", "X");
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Access your private key and get the corresponding address:
JavaScript

const privateKey = "YourPrivateKeyHere";
const keychain = avax.XChain().keyChain();
const keypair = keychain.importKey(privateKey);
const address = keypair.getAddressString();
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Create and sign the transaction:
JavaScript

const tx = await avax.XChain().buildBaseTx(
    utxos, // unspent transaction outputs
    new avalanche.BN(100), // amount to send
    assetID, // asset ID
    [address], // addresses to send the output
    [address], // addresses being used in the inputs
    [address], // addresses to send the change
);
const signedTx = keychain.signTx(tx);
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Repeat the transaction:
JavaScript

for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    const txID = await avax.XChain().issueTx(signedTx);
    console.log(`Transaction ${i} submitted with ID ${txID}`);
}



Please replace "YourPrivateKeyHere" with your actual private key. Also, you’ll need to replace utxos and assetID with your actual unspent transaction outputs and asset ID.

This is a simplified example and might not work as-is. You’ll need to handle errors and possibly add delays between transactions to avoid rate limits or other issues. Always test with small amounts first.

Remember, never share your private key with anyone or any site that you do not trust. It’s also important to note that interacting with blockchains carries certain risks and responsibilities, and you should only proceed if you’re confident in your understanding of these technologies. If you’re not sure, consider seeking advice from a professional or a trusted community member.
